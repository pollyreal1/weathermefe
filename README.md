# Wather me app Front end

This will work independently without the API but the searches module won't work; because that module needs the backend API.

For your backend to work please update the .env file with the link of your API(8000 is the default run port for laravel serve)

```
VUE_APP_API=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
